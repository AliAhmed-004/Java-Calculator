# Java-Calculator
This is a project I made in my 2nd semester of BS Computer Science.
The calculator is made entirely in java, allowing the users to perform simple as well as scientific calculations with ease.
With beautiful, simplistic UI and ability to change themes from a list of different themes (which are probably unnecessary), you will get the feeling of calculating calculations right at your home (I don't know what I'm saying).

# Why is this uploaded late?
Well, when I originally made the project, I never knew Git and Github existed so I lost the code altogether. I learned about it very late, and could'nt upload this as well as some other projects on time. I will try to make the other project from scratch as well and upload it on my Github.

# What's different from the original code?
Well, the major difference is that the themes which I selected in the past are not in this revised version. the 3 themes are Oceanic, Midnight and Coffee.
Other than that, the past code was round about 900 lines or so. This revised code is 541 lines of code. This may partially be due to a little less scientific functions than before.
I also managed to add separate methods for tasks like changing the mode and theme, which I didn't do before.
