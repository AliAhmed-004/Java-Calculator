# Java-Calculator
This is a project I made in my 2nd semester of BS Computer Science.
The calculator is made entirely in java, allowing the users to perform simple as well as scientific calculations with ease.
With beautiful, simplistic UI and ability to change themes from a list of different themes (which are probably unnecessary), you will get the feeling of calculating calculations right at your home (I don't know what I'm saying).

# Why is this uploaded late?
Well, when I originally made the project, I never knew Git and Github existed so I lost the code altogether. I learned about it very late, and could'nt upload this as well as another project on time. I will try to make the other project from scratch as well and upload it on my Github.
